This repository contains the source code and relational database components for a user-friendly GUI application designed to streamline course scheduling and adminstration. Powered by Apache Derby, a relational database system. This project uses SQL to interact with the database and store and manage information related to the semesters, courses, students and their schedules within the course scheduling system.


Users can access the GUI from the Adminstrator and Student sides.

From the Adminstrator side, users can add new Semesters, Courses and enroll students into the database.
