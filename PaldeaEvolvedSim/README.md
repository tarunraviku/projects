This project is designed to simulate the chances of pulling cards from real Pokemon Paldea Evolved packs from the comfort of your computer.

Each 'Paldea Evolved' pack consists of 10 cards. The first 4 cards are guaranteed to be Common cards. The next 3 cards are guaranteed to be 
uncommon cards. The following card is guaranteed to be a Reverse Holo. The ninth card guarantees a reverse holo or better. The tenth card 
guarantees a rare holo or better.

The Ninth and Tenth cards have special drop rates, as they have the possibility of containing valuable cards.

Ninth Card - 1 in 13 chance of pulling an Illustration Rare, 1 in 32 chance of pulling a Special Illustration rare
Tenth Card - 1 in 7 chance of pulling a Double Rare, 1 in 15 chance of pulling an Ultra Rare, 1 in 57 chance of pulling a Hyper Rare.
